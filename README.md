Project X, Super Break-Out game

Note: This project requires the JACK compiler and emulator for the Nand To Tetris Software Suite supplied on nand2tetris.org.

To run this project, compile it with the JACK compiler like so:

> JackCompiler.sh dir

where `dir` is a directory containing the supplied .jack files. Then run the code in the VM emulator.

Instruction screens will appear walking the user through gameplay.
